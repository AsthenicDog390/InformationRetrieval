    "guidelines": "UK’s Open Banking regulation, which has parallels to the EU’s second payment service directive (PSD2), went live in January 2018. This piece of legislation “will require banks to open their payments infrastructure and customer data assets to third parties”. As a result, banks no longer have a monopoly on user data if clients grant permission. \n\nChallenger banks are small, recently created retail banks that compete directly with the longer-established banks in the UK. Specifically, seeking market share from the big four UK retail banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, and NatWest Group). The banks distinguish themselves from the historic banks by modern financial technology practices, such as online-only operations, that avoid the costs and complexities of traditional banking. The largest UK-operating challenger banks include Atom Bank, Revolut, Starling, N26, and Tide.\n\nRelevant documents and entities will discuss how challenger banks have used open banking to develop new products or capture market share from traditional retail banks in the UK."

Many arguments have been made to why Japan attacked the United States, especially considering potential military retaliation.  \n\nFirstly, fueled by successful campaigns in China and Russia, Japan wanted to be a global power. In comparison, America was trying to limit this by placing embargoes on key products and resources to restain Japan's empire building. War seemed inevitable, especially since the 1940 signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Italy, and Germany. Being much militarily weaker than the US, some argue that Japan needed a surprise attack, and Pearl Harbour was a prime target due to its strategic importance in the Pacific. \n\nMany also argue that Japan anticipated America's reaction incorrectly. There was a perceived anti-intervention lobby within the US Congress. The Japanese believed that the decisive destruction of Pearl Harbour might deter the Americans from getting further involved in a conflict.\nWhile others highlight historical grievances that made Japan bullish on an attack, including Western blocking of a race equality clause in the Treaty of Versailles and multilateral arms limitation placed on Japan.

For example, Operation Sealion, the proposed 1940 amphibious assault on southern England, was postponed due to lack of equipment. Also, several people argue that invading Britain would have pushed the United States into the conflict earlier. Furthermore, the Soviet Union may not have stayed on the sidelines and allowed a German superpower to rise, which may have created the two-front conflict either way.

For example, Nicholas II was viewed as a weak leader, the Russo-Japanese War, Bloody Sunday, Tsarina unpopularity, and WWI.

Labour has lost political weight in Scotland since the Blair era, and Conservatives historically struggle to penetrate a more left-wing Scottish demographic. Brexit further exacerbated this political unease, i.e. right-leaning Britain and left-leaning Scotland. While the younger demographic is more likely to be independence supporters and the older demographic is more likely to be pro-union.\n\nThere are several arguments that Scotland independence is not inevitable. Historically there has been a union for 300+ years covering a full range of circumstances (world wars, successes). Economically, Britain funds lots of Scottish spending through Barnett-based funding, Scotland's oil is less valuable than previously, and there is much economic uncertainly around currency and debt. Some also argue that Scotland has large political independence due to devolution; thus, independence is unnecessary."

According to a study of political behaviour among Black Americans, Kaepernick was “a powerful mobilising force” who directly inspired nearly one-third of Black people polled to donate to a political cause, attend a protest or boycott the NFL.

Another common argument favouring retaining the Electoral College is that it brings “stability and certainty” as a constitutional structure in presidential elections.  \n\nOn the other hand, advocates of abolishing the Electoral College system point claim that insofar as democracy should represent the rule of the majority, the Electoral College is a fundamentally undemocratic institution. The evidence for this assertion is clear; in many recent presidential elections, the office went to the loser of the popular vote, e.g. 2000 with George W. Bush and 2016 with Donald J Trump. In the latter example, Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes, highlighting critics’ views that voters would become disenfranchised due to the Electoral College system."

Therefore, have share liability with users. The issue inforcing this is twofold (1) real-time speed and scale of social media, and (2) when content is controversial but less illegal. Nonetheless, many countries worldwide have been pushing towards Social Media companies having increased liability for their content, although this is a legislative challenge."

Add relevant context or details that might be missing to increase precision, such as time frames, locations, or specific aspects of the topic.\n3. Remove any noise or ambiguity by clarifying vague terms or phrases that could match irrelevant documents.\n4.

Use phrase queries or quoted phrases for terms that must appear together to ensure relevance and reduce false positives.\n7. Maintain the original intent of the query while making these adjustments to ensure that the search results remain relevant to the user's information need.\n\nBy following these steps, the optimized query should improve retrieval performance by increasing precision, recall, and overall relevance of the search results, which in turn should positively affect metrics such as map score, recip_rank, P_10, recall_100, and ndcg_cut_10.",

    "guidelines": "The Arab Spring was a series of anti-government protests and uprisings that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It began with the Tunisian Revolution, which was in response to corruption and economic stagnation, spreading to Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, and Bahrain, and mass protests in other Arab nations.\n\nSocial media played a significant role in facilitating communication and conversations among political protests (pro and anti-government). However, this varied by country significantly, i.e. Egyptians called to protest online with the help of a Facebook campaign, We Are All Khaled Said. Other political pundits say that although Social Media did speed up political action, the underlying political factor was already there and may have happened regardless."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Populist is a broad term that describes, typically a politician, who targets people who feel that established elite groups disregard their concerns. Some critics highlight negative connotations, including criticising foreign migration or minorities.\n\nIn recent years, populism has been stronger in Eastern Europe, i.e. Bulgaria, Hungary, Austrian, and Poland, etc. have seen the rise of populist politicians. Right-wing populist movements have also gained momentum in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. In Hungary and Poland, some critics argue this has led to an erosion of the rule of law, increased persecution, and authoritarianism.\n\nEuropean Union is a political union of democratic nations. However, radical right-wing politics reject what the EU stands for and how it works, i.e. against European supranational integration and push for national policies. Populists also criticise the EU's perceived bureaucracy and failures - common arguments during the Brexit Leave campaign. The EU is founded based on shared democratic values that countries need to be relatively ideologically aligned to function within a political union. There is also the threat that disillusioned Eastern European countries will turn away from the EU and toward Russia."
