Your task is to refine a given search query to maximize retrieval performance. Focus on the following principles and apply them strategically.\n\n1. **Concept Dissection & Expansion:** Identify the core concepts represented within the query. Consider related terms, synonyms, and broader/narrower concepts that might be present in relevant documents but not explicitly stated in the initial query. Think about how these concepts might be represented in various writing styles and industry jargon.\n\n2. **Noise Reduction & Precision:** Examine the query for any phrasing that introduces ambiguity or focuses on a minor aspect of the topic. Eliminate unnecessary qualifiers or restrictive language that limits the scope without contributing meaningfully to precision. Prioritize concise language.\n\n3. **Linguistic Normalization:** Apply stemming or lemmatization techniques to normalize word forms and account for variations in document vocabulary.  Consider stop word removal, but only if you are certain it won’s negatively impact recall by removing critical context.\n\n4. **Phrase Refinement:** Identify any multi-word phrases within the query. Consider breaking down complex phrases into simpler terms while retaining the overall meaning. Experiment with alternative phrasings that better capture the nuances of the topic.  Look for opportunities to combine terms using boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine the scope.\n\n5. **Contextual Enrichment (Cautiously):** If initial testing reveals a lack of relevant results, cautiously add context terms *only if* they are highly likely to narrow the search to pertinent documents and won’t introduce excessive noise.\n\n6. **Performance Metrics Focus:** Your primary goal is to improve these metrics: map score, recip_rank, P_10, recall_100, and ndcg_cut_10.

This piece of legislation “will require banks to open their payments infrastructure and customer data assets to third parties”. As a result, banks no longer have a monopoly on user data if clients grant permission. \n\nChallenger banks are small, recently created retail banks that compete directly with the longer-established banks in the UK. Specifically, seeking market share from the big four UK retail banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, and NatWest Group). The banks distinguish themselves from the historic banks by modern financial technology practices, such as online-only operations, that avoid the costs and complexities of traditional banking. The largest UK-operating challenger banks include Atom Bank, Revolut, Starling, N26, and Tide.\n\nRelevant documents and entities will discuss how challenger banks have used open banking to develop new products or capture market share from traditional retail banks in the UK."

Many arguments have been made to why Japan attacked the United States, especially considering potential military retaliation.  \n\nFirstly, fueled by successful campaigns in China and Russia, Japan wanted to be a global power. In comparison, America was trying to limit this by placing embargoes on key products and resources to restain Japan's empire building. War seemed inevitable, especially since the 1940 signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Italy, and Germany. Being much militarily weaker than the US, some argue that Japan needed a surprise attack, and Pearl Harbour was a prime target due to its strategic importance in the Pacific. \n\nMany also argue that Japan anticipated America's reaction incorrectly. There was a perceived anti-intervention lobby within the US Congress. The Japanese believed that the decisive destruction of Pearl Harbour might deter the Americans from getting further involved in a conflict.\nWhile others highlight historical grievances that made Japan bullish on an attack, including Western blocking of a race equality clause in the Treaty of Versailles and multilateral arms limitation placed on Japan.

For example, Operation Sealion, the proposed 1940 amphibious assault on southern England, was postponed due to lack of equipment. Also, several people argue that invading Britain would have pushed the United States into the conflict earlier.

Several historians point to the fact that French support was crucial for gaining independence. Specifically, the French provided supplies, arms and ammunition, uniforms, troops and naval support to the Continental Army under George Washington. This was part of the Treaty of Alliance. As well as the direct support in America, France also was an active threat to Great Britain in other parts of the Empire, which meant Britains focus was spread. \n\nNonetheless, some historians put forward other key reasons why Great Britain lost the Revolutionary War, i.e. fighting on American soil, poor military tactics, economic concerns, Spanish support, and lack of political will."

After that, however, the victorious Allied Powers (led by Britain, France, the United States and Italy) had to complete peace treaties with their opponents in the Central Powers (Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire). The most important of these treaties was the Treaty of Versailles, ending the war with Germany produced by the Paris Peace Conference and signed in 1919. \n\nMany saw the Treaty of Versailles as a failure as WWII erupted some 20 years later. Some historians highlight that the Treaty was overly punitive or even humiliating toward Germany and increased the likelihood of WII, which has been connected to the rise of Adolf Hilter and Nazi Germany. However, other historians argue these types of concessions were standard for a losing nation at the time. The Allies also all had different incentives and political motivations towards Germany, with several arguably not seeing Germany as a future threat. \n\nLike any treaty, the consequences of breaking it should be significant. However, when Hilter came into power and violated many of the Treaty of Versailles terms, the Allies took a stance of appeasement. Thus, it is debatable whether the treaty itself is to balme. While other factors also played into the rise of Nazi Germany, i.e. economic crisis following the Wall Street crash in 1929 and propaganda."

    "guidelines": "Most Americans who cast a ballot to elect the president and vice president of the United States believe they vote directly for their candidate. The reality is that the Electoral College elects both the president and, in turn, the vice president under Article II, Section 1, of the US Constitution. Proponents of the Electoral College claim that the risks in the present system are exaggerated, pointing to the limited number of occasions where concerns around undemocratic outcomes have come to fruition. Another common argument favouring retaining the Electoral College is that it brings “stability and certainty” as a constitutional structure in presidential elections.  \n\nOn the other hand, advocates of abolishing the Electoral College system point claim that insofar as democracy should represent the rule of the majority, the Electoral College is a fundamentally undemocratic institution. The evidence for this assertion is clear; in many recent presidential elections, the office went to the loser of the popular vote, e.g. 2000 with George W. Bush and 2016 with Donald J Trump. In the latter example, Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes, highlighting critics’ views that voters would become disenfranchised due to the Electoral College system."

    "guidelines": "There have been two key binary referendums in the UK in recent years: (1) the 2014 vote on Scottish Independence and (2) the 2016 vote on whether the UK should leave the EU (i.e. Brexit).\n\nSome critics of binary referendums believe they trivialise highly complex issues by oversimplifying them into a yes-or-no vote. Where political campaigning can decide the outcome irrespective of the fact, some point to Boris Johnson's £350m per week EU bill as a powerful example. Others feel referendums are democracy in action and allow the public to decide on important matters directly. Finally, others highlight the exact wording, winning thresholds, or the number of choices (i.e. should there be a middle ground?) can have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of these referendums.\n\nThere have also been democratic consequences before, during and after referendums. For example, this directly splits countries and nations into binary camps (i.e. yes vs no and leave vs remain), which some argue has created greater societal divides. There is also questions about the political mandate that close referendum wins give leaders, i.e. how much to consider the losing population."

    "guidelines": "Universal health coverage means that all people have access to free health services. For example, public healthcare provided by the NHS in Britain or provincial healthcare in Canada. This is in contrast to the United States, where healthcare is primarily paid for via expensive health insurance funded individually or by corporate policies. \n\nSome argue the disadvantages of universal healthcare lead to large upfront costs and logistical challenges. In addition, given rising populations and the cost of healthcare, universal healthcare would require significant tax rises to fund. On the other hand, the benefit of universal healthcare is a reduction in health disparities and leads to a healthier populace. Currently, in the United States, low socioeconomic status is linked to decreased access to quality healthcare and increased risk of non-communicable chronic conditions.\n\nUniversal healthcare has increasingly become a polarising issue within the United States. Many sections of the Republican Party, which support low-tax and free-market, vehemently oppose many forms of universal healthcare. For example, trying to block repeatedly and then replace the Affordable Care Act brought in by Barack Obama. Relevant sources will focus on political controversies and arguments within America."

Who should pay the vast resources required to reduce climate change (i.e. technology investment, caping resources used, etc.) and reduce the impact of climate change (i.e. flood prevention,  migration, etc.) is both a political and environmental question. This has caused much debate in recent climate conferences, i.e. COPs in Paris and Glasgow.\n\nThe developed countries (UK, Western Europe, US, Japan, Australia, etc.) have contributed far longer to climate change and have generally higher CO2 emissions per capita. They also have per capita much higher incomes, and overall, are more able to contribute to the cost of climate change. Many feel it is developed countries moral obligation to pay more. Nonetheless, this is politically challenging for domestic politics, specifically in the US.\n\nDeveloping countries with large populations (China, India, Pakistan, etc.) have become some of the largest polluters in recent years. As developing countries progress economically, this will naturally result in more emissions, i.e. more cars, more electricity, more construction. This creates a conflict between development and climate change. Developing countries are also disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change, i.e. flooding, drought, etc. \n\nOverall, climate change is a global issue that will require countries, companies, and people to come together."
