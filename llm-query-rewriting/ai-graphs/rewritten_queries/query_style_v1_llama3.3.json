    "domain": "finance",
    "guidelines": "UK’s Open Banking regulation, which has parallels to the EU’s second payment service directive (PSD2), went live in January 2018. This piece of legislation “will require banks to open their payments infrastructure and customer data assets to third parties”. As a result, banks no longer have a monopoly on user data if clients grant permission. \n\nChallenger banks are small, recently created retail banks that compete directly with the longer-established banks in the UK. Specifically, seeking market share from the \"big four\" UK retail banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, and NatWest Group). The banks distinguish themselves from the historic banks by modern financial technology practices, such as online-only operations, that avoid the costs and complexities of traditional banking. The largest UK-operating challenger banks include Atom Bank, Revolut, Starling, N26, and Tide.\n\nRelevant documents and entities will discuss how challenger banks have used open banking to develop new products or capture market share from traditional retail banks in the UK."

    "domain": "finance",
    "guidelines": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.\n\nSince its inception in 2008, Bitcoin has seen a huge increase in both valuation and transactions. This included being controversially introduced as El Salvador national currency. \n\nThere are technology challenges bitcoin faces to being widely used for transactions. Including but not limited to: (1) carbon footprint for bitcoin mining, (2) cost and speed of payments, (3) technology-driven excessive volatility, and (4) security. In fact, other cryptocurrencies might be much better suited (Ether, Ripple, or Elon Musk argues DOGE)."

Investors believe the price will trend toward this intrinsic value over the medium-to-long term.\n\nGrowth investing is an investment style that invests in growth stocks—that is, newer companies or sectors whose earnings are expected to increase at an above-average rate compared to their industry sector or the overall market.\n\nOver the last decade, large tech companies (growth companies) have seen massive growth, i.e. Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Netflix – once named FAANG stocks. Investing in emerging industries and technologies, such as Tesla for electric cars, have generally outperformed more traditional sectors and companies."

This can be especially appealing for developing countries with highly volatile currencies. The hong kong dollar is perhaps the most famous fixed exchange rate currently.\n\nHowever, non-fixed currencies naturally reflect the demand and supply of two individual currencies, driven by economic prospects, trade, inflation, and interest rates. To keep currencies artificially fixed may be difficult and require high-interest rates and deflating the economy. In recent years, there have been many examples where currencies are forced out of the fixed exchange rate, i.e. UK leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1992 or Swiss franc in 2015."

There will often need to be further investment in tools and the supply chain to get unit economics down. If something goes wrong with the product, the business will need to fix it (either recall or site visit) to alleviate the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, most software businesses are based largely on standard code bases that can be written on a computer. Early prototypes can be developed quickly and iteration can be done daily. If there is a bug in a launched product, this can be patched remotely."

This is supported by many economics and investment professionals to ensure one protects and grows one's assets over a long period.\n\nHowever, if you are looking to get \"rich\" it could be argued taking several high-risk bets might be more effective. For example, early-stage investors in startups, founder equity (Elon Musk, Bill Gates, etc.), options trading, cryptocurrencies. These types of assets allocation are far riskier in terms of returns, i.e. you could lose most of your wealth.

UK defence spending had fallen significantly during the 1920s, from over £700 million in 1919 to 100 million in 1931.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1939, the UK launched a substantial programme of re-arming, recognising that war with Hitler was becoming increasingly likely. Although Appeasement was also motivated by Chamberlain's desire to end war, some argue this meant that the UK was more prepared in 1939 when war eventually broke out.  \n\nDespite these efforts, Germany was still better prepared for war under Hilter's single-minded preparation since he came to power in 1933. However, without Appeasement, the differential might have been much worse."

Henry VIII loved his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, however her inability to produce a male heir made him seek divorce. However, divorce was incomprehensible in the eyes of the Catholic faith. He, therefore, looked to the reformation sweeping Germany in the 1500s. This reformation pathed the way for radical church reforms, one of which allowed divorce. \n\nIn 1534, Henry used Parliament to grant the Act of Supremacy, which allowed him to annul his marriage to Catherine as it made the monarch the head of the English Church. Some sources also highlight Anne Boleyn's influence over Henry VIII, who engaged in reformist thinking.

    "guidelines": "The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was a surprise military strike by Imperial Japan upon the United States at the naval base at Pearl Harbor. Many arguments have been made to why Japan attacked the United States, especially considering potential military retaliation.  \n\nFirstly, fueled by successful campaigns in China and Russia, Japan wanted to be a global power. In comparison, America was trying to limit this by placing embargoes on key products and resources to restain Japan's empire building. War seemed inevitable, especially since the 1940 signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Italy, and Germany. Being much militarily weaker than the US, some argue that Japan needed a surprise attack, and Pearl Harbour was a prime target due to its strategic importance in the Pacific. \n\nMany also argue that Japan anticipated America's reaction incorrectly. There was a perceived anti-intervention lobby within the US Congress. The Japanese believed that the decisive destruction of Pearl Harbour might deter the Americans from getting further involved in a conflict.\nWhile others highlight historical grievances that made Japan bullish on an attack, including Western blocking of a race equality clause in the Treaty of Versailles and multilateral arms limitation placed on Japan. Additionally, some perceived Japan's political democracy had taken an increasingly nationalist tone since the Great Depression."

In one of the biggest electoral swings of the twentieth century, the Labour Party won the general election decisively.\n\nSome argue Churchill was largely seen as a war-time leader and less trusted domestic and foreign policy. However, the public wanted a government to look after soldiers and families who had fought for their country. Labour and Clement Attlee better understood this by promising national healthcare and welfare that reflected the post-1945 mood. In comparison, the Conservatives tried to use Churchill’s popular appeal, lowering taxation, maintaining defence spending and encouraging private business interests.\n\nThe Conservatives were also easy political targets for the past mistakes during interwar periods, i.e. Appeasement and the Great Depression.

    "domain": "history",
    "guidelines": "In 1941, Operation Barbarossa transformed Nazi Germany's war from a one-front struggle, against arguable weakened Britain and the still-neutral United States, into a two-front conflict. The Eastern Front absorbed much of the German army and inflicted roughly two-thirds of German casualties due to Soviet resistance, conditions, and lack of equipment. As a result, many point to Hitler's decision to invade the Soviet Union as a key tactical mistake.\n\nHowever, it is heavily debatable if Germany had invaded Britain and not the Soviet Union whether this would have ultimately changed the war's outcome. Moreover, whether Germany could have successfully invaded Britain is open for debate. For example, Operation Sealion, the proposed 1940 amphibious assault on southern England, was postponed due to lack of equipment. Also, several people argue that invading Britain would have pushed the United States into the conflict earlier. Furthermore, the Soviet Union may not have stayed on the sidelines and allowed a German superpower to rise, which may have created the two-front conflict either way. There is considerable uncertainty with discussion around alternative versions of military strategy decisions."

Some argue that religion was a key motivating factor, i.e. “armed pilgrimage”. The public at the time was deeply religious, and this would be a strong motivator if they felt due to piety and remission of sins.

After that, however, the victorious Allied Powers (led by Britain, France, the United States and Italy) had to complete peace treaties with their opponents in the Central Powers (Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire). The most important of these treaties was the Treaty of Versailles, ending the war with Germany produced by the Paris Peace Conference and signed in 1919. \n\nMany saw the Treaty of Versailles as a failure as WWII erupted some 20 years later. Some historians highlight that the Treaty was overly punitive or even humiliating toward Germany and increased the likelihood of WII, which has been connected to the rise of Adolf Hilter and Nazi Germany. However, other historians argue these types of concessions were standard for a losing nation at the time. The Allies also all had different incentives and political motivations towards Germany, with several arguably not seeing Germany as a future threat. \n\nLike any treaty, the consequences of breaking it should be significant. However, when Hilter came into power and violated many of the Treaty of Versailles terms, the Allies took a stance of appeasement. Thus, it is debatable whether the treaty itself is to balme.

This made it much harder for United States Government to control the narrative with previous war propaganda techniques. \n\nMany historians point to negative media coverage as a key cause of the negative public option of the Vietnam War, specifically the public seeing graphic and uncensored images for the first time. Some argue the media executive had a negative view of the war. \n\nHowever, other historians highlight other reasons for some of the public's negative views.

Short-term facts and opinions are less central to this question.\n\nSome argue that Scottish independence is inevitable given the surge of support towards SNP in recent decades.

Brexit further exacerbated this political unease, i.e. right-leaning Britain and left-leaning Scotland. While the younger demographic is more likely to be independence supporters and the older demographic is more likely to be pro-union.\n\nThere are several arguments that Scotland independence is not inevitable. Historically there has been a union for 300+ years covering a full range of circumstances (world wars, successes). Economically, Britain funds lots of Scottish spending through Barnett-based funding, Scotland's oil is less valuable than previously, and there is much economic uncertainly around currency and debt.

    "query": "What role did Colin Kaepernick play in shaping the national conversation about systemic racism and social justice in the United States?",
    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "In 2016, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick took the knee during the national anthem at an NFL game in protest of police brutality and racial injustice in America. The immediate reactions were highly polarised – on the political right, Kaepernick’s kneeling sparked anger, with critics viewing the player’s defiance as an affront to patriotism; meanwhile, for those sympathetic to Kaepernick’s motivations, it inspired meaningful discourse and offered a blueprint for how to protest with impact peacefully.\n\nMore than five years on, journalists now refer to the mass political movement that this simple gesture produced as ‘The Kaepernick Effect.’ Kaepernick’s protests not only stoked passion and awareness in the public consciousness; they went beyond that within the Black community. According to a study of political behaviour among Black Americans, Kaepernick was “a powerful mobilising force” who directly inspired nearly one-third of Black people polled to donate to a political cause, attend a protest or boycott the NFL. In addition, more than half of respondents said Kaepernick inspired them to vote in a local or national election."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Defying predictions that their participation would be lacklustre, Latinos in the 2012 US presidential elections turned out in record numbers. They voted for Barack Obama by broad margins, tipping the balance in at least three swing states and securing their position as an organized force in American politics with the power to move national elections. Overall, Barack Obama won 71% of the Hispanic vote while Mitt Romney won only 27%. The gap of 44 percentage points was even more significant than Barack Obama’s 36-point advantage over John McCain during the 2008 elections.\n\nLatinos had such a strong turnout in the 2012 elections that it lifted them to 10% of voters nationwide, increasing from 6% in 2000. Their most significant impact was in several battleground states portrayed as close contests before Election Day. In Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, Barack Obama won the Hispanic vote by significant percentages that well exceeded margins of victory. Latinos significantly increased their share of total voters in each of those states, gaining influence that will prove to continue to be decisive in future elections."

    "query": "Should the Electoral College system in United States presidential elections be abolished or reformed?",
    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Most Americans who cast a ballot to elect the president and vice president of the United States believe they vote directly for their candidate. The reality is that the Electoral College elects both the president and, in turn, the vice president under Article II, Section 1, of the US Constitution. Proponents of the Electoral College claim that the risks in the present system are exaggerated, pointing to the limited number of occasions where concerns around undemocratic outcomes have come to fruition. Another common argument favouring retaining the Electoral College is that it brings “stability and certainty” as a constitutional structure in presidential elections.  \n\nOn the other hand, advocates of abolishing the Electoral College system point claim that insofar as democracy should represent the rule of the majority, the Electoral College is a fundamentally undemocratic institution. The evidence for this assertion is clear; in many recent presidential elections, the office went to the loser of the popular vote, e.g. 2000 with George W. Bush and 2016 with Donald J Trump. In the latter example, Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes, highlighting critics’ views that voters would become disenfranchised due to the Electoral College system."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "There have been two key binary referendums in the UK in recent years: (1) the 2014 vote on Scottish Independence and (2) the 2016 vote on whether the UK should leave the EU (i.e. Brexit).\n\nSome critics of binary referendums believe they trivialise highly complex issues by oversimplifying them into a \"yes-or-no\" vote. Where political campaigning can decide the outcome irrespective of the fact, some point to Boris Johnson's £350m per week EU bill as a powerful example. Others feel referendums are democracy in action and allow the public to decide on important matters directly. Finally, others highlight the exact wording, winning thresholds, or the number of choices (i.e. should there be a middle ground?) can have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of these referendums.\n\nThere have also been democratic consequences before, during and after referendums. For example, this directly splits countries and nations into binary camps (i.e. yes vs no and leave vs remain), which some argue has created greater societal divides. There is also questions about the political mandate that close referendum wins give leaders, i.e. how much to consider the losing population."

    "query": "What are the political reasons behind the controversy surrounding universal healthcare systems in the United States, including Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and how do they impact healthcare policy and reform debates?",
    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Universal health coverage means that all people have access to free health services. For example, public healthcare provided by the NHS in Britain or provincial healthcare in Canada. This is in contrast to the United States, where healthcare is primarily paid for via expensive health insurance funded individually or by corporate policies. \n\nSome argue the disadvantages of universal healthcare lead to large upfront costs and logistical challenges. In addition, given rising populations and the cost of healthcare, universal healthcare would require significant tax rises to fund. On the other hand, the benefit of universal healthcare is a reduction in health disparities and leads to a healthier populace. Currently, in the United States, low socioeconomic status is linked to decreased access to quality healthcare and increased risk of non-communicable chronic conditions.\n\nUniversal healthcare has increasingly become a polarising issue within the United States. Many sections of the Republican Party, which support low-tax and free-market, vehemently oppose many forms of universal healthcare. For example, trying to block repeatedly and then replace the Affordable Care Act brought in by Barack Obama. Relevant sources will focus on political controversies and arguments within America."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather shifts, which has increased since the industrial revolution in 1800. The primary driver is burning fossil fuels, i.e. coal, oil, and gas. \"Who should pay\" the vast resources required to reduce climate change (i.e. technology investment, caping resources used, etc.) and reduce the impact of climate change (i.e. flood prevention,  migration, etc.) is both a political and environmental question. This has caused much debate in recent climate conferences, i.e. COPs in Paris and Glasgow.\n\nThe developed countries (UK, Western Europe, US, Japan, Australia, etc.) have contributed far longer to climate change and have generally higher CO2 emissions per capita. They also have per capita much higher incomes, and overall, are more able to contribute to the cost of climate change. Many feel it is developed countries moral obligation to pay more. Nonetheless, this is politically challenging for domestic politics, specifically in the US.\n\nDeveloping countries with large populations (China, India, Pakistan, etc.) have become some of the largest polluters in recent years. As developing countries progress economically, this will naturally result in more emissions, i.e. more cars, more electricity, more construction. This creates a conflict between development and climate change. Developing countries are also disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change, i.e. flooding, drought, etc. \n\nOverall, climate change is a global issue that will require countries, companies, and people to come together."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 US presidential election to Donald Trump in 2016. Political commentators highlight many reasons for Clinton's loss. \n\nFor example, Donald Trump managed to craft a strong populist message that resonated with many voters who were disenfranchised with current politics, particularly with the \"political elite\" who some felt Clinton represented. The Democratats were also divided, specifically far-left factions led by Bernie Sanders. Political gridlock under an Obama Administration that, rightly or wrongly, some felt the public wanting change. Hilary also had relatively low personal approval ratings, which were not helped by the FBI investigation into her use of email. Some also point to external factors, including Russian interference."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Tony Blair rebranded the Labour party in Britain to \"New Labour\" in the mid-1990s to regain the electorate's trust and portray a departure from their traditional socialist policies. This was a noticeable shift from left-wing politics to the centre of British politics.\n\nTony Blair reduced the strength of Labour's association with trade unions by repealing the party's Clause IV, which committed the party to \"common ownership of the means of production\". Again, seeking to appeal to both working and middle-class Britain. \n\nTony Blair led Labour to a landslide victory in 1997, which many also attribute to his leadership and start quality. He was supported by Gordon Brown, who would become Chancellor of the Exchequer. Nonetheless, the fact the Conservatives were in such disarray under John Major helped Tony Blair. Specifically, the pound sterling dropped out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday and the government was defeated over the Maastricht Treaty."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.) have been under increasing public and political pressure regarding content and actions made by users on platforms. For example, if a graphic or illegal video is posted on Facebook, Youtube or Twitter, how much liability lies with the person posting versus the company hosting the video? \n\nSome argue that Social Media, and the internet in general, needs to be protected as a means for people to interact openly, pointing to many of the positives social media has brought, i.e. political activism, online discussion, etc. This support the legal position that Social Media is not a publisher but allows people to publish their content. \n\nHowever, others argue that Social Media has a duty of care to users and should remove content that violates their terms and conditions (this commonly happens today). Therefore, have share liability with users. The issue inforcing this is twofold (1) real-time speed and scale of social media, and (2) when content is controversial but less illegal. Nonetheless, many countries worldwide have been pushing towards Social Media companies having increased liability for their content, although this is a legislative challenge."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "The Arab Spring was a series of anti-government protests and uprisings that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It began with the Tunisian Revolution, which was in response to corruption and economic stagnation, spreading to Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, and Bahrain, and mass protests in other Arab nations.\n\nSocial media played a significant role in facilitating communication and conversations among political protests (pro and anti-government). However, this varied by country significantly, i.e. Egyptians called to protest online with the help of a Facebook campaign, \"We Are All Khaled Said\". Other political pundits say that although Social Media did speed up political action, the underlying political factor was already there and may have happened regardless."

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "\"Populist\" is a broad term that describes, typically a politician, who targets people who feel that established elite groups disregard their concerns. Some critics highlight negative connotations, including criticising foreign migration or minorities.\n\nIn recent years, populism has been stronger in Eastern Europe, i.e. Bulgaria, Hungary, Austrian, and Poland, etc. have seen the rise of populist politicians. Right-wing populist movements have also gained momentum in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. In Hungary and Poland, some critics argue this has led to an erosion of the rule of law, increased persecution, and authoritarianism.\n\nEuropean Union is a political union of democratic nations. However, radical right-wing politics reject what the EU stands for and how it works, i.e. against European supranational integration and push for national policies. Populists also criticise the EU's perceived bureaucracy and failures - common arguments during the Brexit Leave campaign. The EU is founded based on shared democratic values that countries need to be relatively ideologically aligned to function within a political union. There is also the threat that disillusioned Eastern European countries will turn away from the EU and toward Russia."
