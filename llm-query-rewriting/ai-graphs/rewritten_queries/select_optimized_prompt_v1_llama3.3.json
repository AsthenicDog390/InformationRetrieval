    "domain": "finance",
    "guidelines": "UK’s Open Banking regulation, which has parallels to the EU’s second payment service directive (PSD2), went live in January 2018. This piece of legislation “will require banks to open their payments infrastructure and customer data assets to third parties”. As a result, banks no longer have a monopoly on user data if clients grant permission. \n\nChallenger banks are small, recently created retail banks that compete directly with the longer-established banks in the UK. Specifically, seeking market share from the big four UK retail banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, and NatWest Group). The banks distinguish themselves from the historic banks by modern financial technology practices, such as online-only operations, that avoid the costs and complexities of traditional banking. The largest UK-operating challenger banks include Atom Bank, Revolut, Starling, N26, and Tide.\n\nRelevant documents and entities will discuss how challenger banks have used open banking to develop new products or capture market share from traditional retail banks in the UK."

    "domain": "finance",
    "guidelines": "Fixed exchange rates can bring benefits in reducing uncertainty due to minimising fluctuations in the currency movements, giving greater confidence for firms to invest (especially exporters). This can be especially appealing for developing countries with highly volatile currencies. The hong kong dollar is perhaps the most famous fixed exchange rate currently.\n\nHowever, non-fixed currencies naturally reflect the demand and supply of two individual currencies, driven by economic prospects, trade, inflation, and interest rates. To keep currencies artificially fixed may be difficult and require high-interest rates and deflating the economy. In recent years, there have been many examples where currencies are forced out of the fixed exchange rate, i.e. UK leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1992 or Swiss franc in 2015."

This is supported by many economics and investment professionals to ensure one protects and grows one's assets over a long period.\n\nHowever, if you are looking to get rich it could be argued taking several high-risk bets might be more effective. For example, early-stage investors in startups, founder equity (Elon Musk, Bill Gates, etc.), options trading, cryptocurrencies.

Critics highlight poor practices in recent accounting scandals, including  Wirecard, Carillion, Satyam Computer Services, South Africa examples, etc. \n\nHowever, it should be highlighted that even if the Big Four were separated, this would not necessarily lead to no accounting scandals.

Although Appeasement was also motivated by Chamberlain's desire to end war, some argue this meant that the UK was more prepared in 1939 when war eventually broke out.  \n\nDespite these efforts, Germany was still better prepared for war under Hilter's single-minded preparation since he came to power in 1933.

Henry VIII loved his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, however her inability to produce a male heir made him seek divorce. However, divorce was incomprehensible in the eyes of the Catholic faith. He, therefore, looked to the reformation sweeping Germany in the 1500s. This reformation pathed the way for radical church reforms, one of which allowed divorce. \n\nIn 1534, Henry used Parliament to grant the Act of Supremacy, which allowed him to annul his marriage to Catherine as it made the monarch the head of the English Church. Some sources also highlight Anne Boleyn's influence over Henry VIII, who engaged in reformist thinking.

    "domain": "history",
    "guidelines": "The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was a surprise military strike by Imperial Japan upon the United States at the naval base at Pearl Harbor. Many arguments have been made to why Japan attacked the United States, especially considering potential military retaliation.  \n\nFirstly, fueled by successful campaigns in China and Russia, Japan wanted to be a global power. In comparison, America was trying to limit this by placing embargoes on key products and resources to restain Japan's empire building. War seemed inevitable, especially since the 1940 signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Italy, and Germany. Being much militarily weaker than the US, some argue that Japan needed a surprise attack, and Pearl Harbour was a prime target due to its strategic importance in the Pacific. \n\nMany also argue that Japan anticipated America's reaction incorrectly. There was a perceived anti-intervention lobby within the US Congress. The Japanese believed that the decisive destruction of Pearl Harbour might deter the Americans from getting further involved in a conflict.\nWhile others highlight historical grievances that made Japan bullish on an attack, including Western blocking of a race equality clause in the Treaty of Versailles and multilateral arms limitation placed on Japan.

    "guidelines": "In 1941, Operation Barbarossa transformed Nazi Germany's war from a one-front struggle, against arguable weakened Britain and the still-neutral United States, into a two-front conflict. The Eastern Front absorbed much of the German army and inflicted roughly two-thirds of German casualties due to Soviet resistance, conditions, and lack of equipment. As a result, many point to Hitler's decision to invade the Soviet Union as a key tactical mistake.\n\nHowever, it is heavily debatable if Germany had invaded Britain and not the Soviet Union whether this would have ultimately changed the war's outcome. Moreover, whether Germany could have successfully invaded Britain is open for debate. For example, Operation Sealion, the proposed 1940 amphibious assault on southern England, was postponed due to lack of equipment. Also, several people argue that invading Britain would have pushed the United States into the conflict earlier. Furthermore, the Soviet Union may not have stayed on the sidelines and allowed a German superpower to rise, which may have created the two-front conflict either way.

    "guidelines": "1918 brought an end to World War I fighting, which had seen an unprecedented loss of life and suffering. After that, however, the victorious Allied Powers (led by Britain, France, the United States and Italy) had to complete peace treaties with their opponents in the Central Powers (Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire). The most important of these treaties was the Treaty of Versailles, ending the war with Germany produced by the Paris Peace Conference and signed in 1919. \n\nMany saw the Treaty of Versailles as a failure as WWII erupted some 20 years later. Some historians highlight that the Treaty was overly punitive or even humiliating toward Germany and increased the likelihood of WII, which has been connected to the rise of Adolf Hilter and Nazi Germany. However, other historians argue these types of concessions were standard for a losing nation at the time. The Allies also all had different incentives and political motivations towards Germany, with several arguably not seeing Germany as a future threat. \n\nLike any treaty, the consequences of breaking it should be significant. However, when Hilter came into power and violated many of the Treaty of Versailles terms, the Allies took a stance of appeasement. Thus, it is debatable whether the treaty itself is to balme. While other factors also played into the rise of Nazi Germany, i.e. economic crisis following the Wall Street crash in 1929 and propaganda."

    "guidelines": "The Vietnam War (1955–75) is often referred to as the first televised war. From 1950 to 1966, Americans who owned televisions skyrocketed from 9% to 93% as televisions became essential for everyday life. This made it much harder for United States Government to control the narrative with previous war propaganda techniques. \n\nMany historians point to negative media coverage as a key cause of the negative public option of the Vietnam War, specifically the public seeing graphic and uncensored images for the first time. Some argue the media executive had a negative view of the war. \n\nHowever, other historians highlight other reasons for some of the public's negative views. For example, the Vietnam war was fought on tough jungle terrain and guerrilla-style warfare was hard to win. As a result, there were many casualties and the war was taking much longer than expected."

For example, Nicholas II was viewed as a weak leader, the Russo-Japanese War, Bloody Sunday, Tsarina unpopularity, and WWI.

    "guidelines": "This questions focuses on the long-term political, economic and social reasoning behind whether Scotland will likely become independent. Short-term facts and opinions are less central to this question.\n\nSome argue that Scottish independence is inevitable given the surge of support towards SNP in recent decades. Labour has lost political weight in Scotland since the Blair era, and Conservatives historically struggle to penetrate a more left-wing Scottish demographic. Brexit further exacerbated this political unease, i.e. right-leaning Britain and left-leaning Scotland. While the younger demographic is more likely to be independence supporters and the older demographic is more likely to be pro-union.\n\nThere are several arguments that Scotland independence is not inevitable. Historically there has been a union for 300+ years covering a full range of circumstances (world wars, successes). Economically, Britain funds lots of Scottish spending through Barnett-based funding, Scotland's oil is less valuable than previously, and there is much economic uncertainly around currency and debt. Some also argue that Scotland has large political independence due to devolution; thus, independence is unnecessary."

Where candidates for the office of chief executive would need to be nominated by a 1200-person nominating committee made up of individuals predominantly representing business interests and other groups close to mainland China. Some Hong Kong residents were upset, seeing these terms as hollow of the true meaning of having a universal vote. \n \nWhile the Umbrella Movement protests did not achieve full universal suffrage, they had some lasting effects. Firstly, it is unlikely that the protests of 2019 would have been as enduring as they were if not for the experience gained by the movement’s protestors five years prior. Additionally, the prosecution of many of the most prominent faces of the Umbrella Movement created a sense of urgency amongst some Hong Kong residents to band together to strengthen resistance efforts. Finally, by highlighting the argued contradictions and injustices, the Umbrella Movement has promoted more politically conscious and active citizenship, especially within Hong Kong’s younger demographics."

The immediate reactions were highly polarised – on the political right, Kaepernick’s kneeling sparked anger, with critics viewing the player’s defiance as an affront to patriotism; meanwhile, for those sympathetic to Kaepernick’s motivations, it inspired meaningful discourse and offered a blueprint for how to protest with impact peacefully.\n\nMore than five years on, journalists now refer to the mass political movement that this simple gesture produced as ‘The Kaepernick Effect.’ Kaepernick’s protests not only stoked passion and awareness in the public consciousness; they went beyond that within the Black community. According to a study of political behaviour among Black Americans, Kaepernick was “a powerful mobilising force” who directly inspired nearly one-third of Black people polled to donate to a political cause, attend a protest or boycott the NFL. In addition, more than half of respondents said Kaepernick inspired them to vote in a local or national election."

Overall, Barack Obama won 71% of the Hispanic vote while Mitt Romney won only 27%. The gap of 44 percentage points was even more significant than Barack Obama’s 36-point advantage over John McCain during the 2008 elections.\n\nLatinos had such a strong turnout in the 2012 elections that it lifted them to 10% of voters nationwide, increasing from 6% in 2000. Their most significant impact was in several battleground states portrayed as close contests before Election Day. In Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, Barack Obama won the Hispanic vote by significant percentages that well exceeded margins of victory.

    "domain": "politics",
    "guidelines": "Most Americans who cast a ballot to elect the president and vice president of the United States believe they vote directly for their candidate. The reality is that the Electoral College elects both the president and, in turn, the vice president under Article II, Section 1, of the US Constitution. Proponents of the Electoral College claim that the risks in the present system are exaggerated, pointing to the limited number of occasions where concerns around undemocratic outcomes have come to fruition. Another common argument favouring retaining the Electoral College is that it brings “stability and certainty” as a constitutional structure in presidential elections.  \n\nOn the other hand, advocates of abolishing the Electoral College system point claim that insofar as democracy should represent the rule of the majority, the Electoral College is a fundamentally undemocratic institution. The evidence for this assertion is clear; in many recent presidential elections, the office went to the loser of the popular vote, e.g. 2000 with George W. Bush and 2016 with Donald J Trump. In the latter example, Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes, highlighting critics’ views that voters would become disenfranchised due to the Electoral College system."

Where political campaigning can decide the outcome irrespective of the fact, some point to Boris Johnson's £350m per week EU bill as a powerful example. Others feel referendums are democracy in action and allow the public to decide on important matters directly. Finally, others highlight the exact wording, winning thresholds, or the number of choices (i.e. should there be a middle ground?) can have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of these referendums.\n\nThere have also been democratic consequences before, during and after referendums. For example, this directly splits countries and nations into binary camps (i.e. yes vs no and leave vs remain), which some argue has created greater societal divides.

For example, public healthcare provided by the NHS in Britain or provincial healthcare in Canada. This is in contrast to the United States, where healthcare is primarily paid for via expensive health insurance funded individually or by corporate policies. \n\nSome argue the disadvantages of universal healthcare lead to large upfront costs and logistical challenges. In addition, given rising populations and the cost of healthcare, universal healthcare would require significant tax rises to fund. On the other hand, the benefit of universal healthcare is a reduction in health disparities and leads to a healthier populace. Currently, in the United States, low socioeconomic status is linked to decreased access to quality healthcare and increased risk of non-communicable chronic conditions.\n\nUniversal healthcare has increasingly become a polarising issue within the United States. Many sections of the Republican Party, which support low-tax and free-market, vehemently oppose many forms of universal healthcare. For example, trying to block repeatedly and then replace the Affordable Care Act brought in by Barack Obama. Relevant sources will focus on political controversies and arguments within America."

This has caused much debate in recent climate conferences, i.e. COPs in Paris and Glasgow.\n\nThe developed countries (UK, Western Europe, US, Japan, Australia, etc.) have contributed far longer to climate change and have generally higher CO2 emissions per capita. They also have per capita much higher incomes, and overall, are more able to contribute to the cost of climate change. Many feel it is developed countries moral obligation to pay more. Nonetheless, this is politically challenging for domestic politics, specifically in the US.\n\nDeveloping countries with large populations (China, India, Pakistan, etc.) have become some of the largest polluters in recent years. As developing countries progress economically, this will naturally result in more emissions, i.e. more cars, more electricity, more construction. This creates a conflict between development and climate change. Developing countries are also disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change, i.e. flooding, drought, etc. \n\nOverall, climate change is a global issue that will require countries, companies, and people to come together."
