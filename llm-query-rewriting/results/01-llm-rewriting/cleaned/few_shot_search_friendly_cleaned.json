This rewritten query is concise, informative, and easy to understand, making it suitable for search engines. Note: The rewritten query does not include the phrase 'push towards electric cars' as it is implied by the term 'electric cars'. Including the phrase in the rewritten query would make it too long and less relevant to the main topic. Therefore, the rewritten query 'electric car demand and raw materials' is a more suitable and search engine-friendly query.

The term 'demand and raw materials' is added to provide more context and specificity to the query. The use of the ampersand (&) symbol between the two terms creates a clear and logical connection between them, indicating that the query is about the demand for raw materials",
