In the expansion approach, we add synonyms and related keywords to the original query to capture its essence and meaning. The rewritten query uses a combination of phrases that convey the same idea as the original query, but with more options and nuances. This approach is useful when: * You want to capture the essence of a query with multiple possible interpretations. * You want to provide more options for users to refine their search results. * You want to make your search results more comprehensive and informative. However, the expansion approach can also lead to: * Increased complexity and noise in search results. * Over-expansion of the query, which can lead to irrelevant results. * Overemphasis on synonyms and related keywords, which can dilute the original intent of the query. To balance the expansion approach, consider the following: * Use a limited number of synonyms and related keywords to avoid over-expansion. * Prioritize the most relevant and specific phrases that capture the essence of the query. * Monitor and refine the expansion approach based on user feedback and search result quality. By using an expansion approach to rewrite queries, you can provide users with more options and nuances, while also ensuring that the search results remain relevant and accurate.",

This approach can help to improve the query's searchability and relevance. However, the above approach can be too extensive and may lead to a query that is too broad or too narrow. A more effective approach would be to use a combination of expansion and ranking techniques to balance the query's specificity and searchability.

Is Scottish independence a necessary step towards a more self-governing nation, or will it lead to a loss of economic stability and cultural identity? Will Scotland's independence mean a shift towards a more decentralized and democratic system, or will it result in a loss of economic resources and a decline in international influence? This approach involves adding synonyms, related keywords, and phrases to the original query to capture the nuances and complexities of the question. By doing so, the rewritten query provides a more comprehensive and detailed search query that can help to retrieve a wider range of relevant documents. Note that this approach can be applied to any query, not just the one provided. The key is to identify the core concepts and themes of the query and then add related keywords and phrases to capture the nuances and complexities of the question. In the context of information retrieval, this approach can be useful for several reasons: 1. **Improved search results**: By adding synonyms and related keywords, the rewritten query can retrieve a wider range of relevant documents that may not have been retrieved by the original query. 2. **Increased precision**: The rewritten query can capture the nuances and complexities of the question, leading to more precise search results that accurately reflect the user's intent. 3. **Enhanced search functionality**: The expanded query can be used to generate a list of related terms and phrases, providing",
