For example, if the query is \"What is the meaning of life?\", the code will not be able to provide a rewritten query. To handle such cases, we need to add additional logic to the `rewrite_query` function.\n\nHere is an updated version of the code that handles ambiguous queries:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef rewrite_query(query):",

This approach helps to ensure that the query is clear and concise, making it easier for search engines to understand its intent and provide relevant results. \n\nIn addition, the rewritten queries use more nuanced language, acknowledging the possibility that external factors may influence Scotland's future independence.

This rephrasing is done to make the query more understandable, specific, and concise.\n\nHere is an example of how this process can be automated using natural language processing (NLP) techniques:\n\n1. Tokenization: Break down the query into individual words or tokens.\n2. Part-of-speech tagging: Identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. Dependency parsing: Analyze the grammatical structure of the query, including subject-verb-object relationships.\n4. Named entity recognition: Identify specific entities mentioned in the query, such as locations (Hong Kong) or events (Umbrella Movement).\n5. Semantic role labeling: Identify the roles played by entities in the query, such as \"location\" or \"event\".\n6. Coreference resolution: Identify and resolve pronouns and other ambiguous references.\n7. Query rephrasing: Use the analysis from the previous steps to rephrase the query and remove ambiguities.\n\nNote that this is a simplified example, and actual NLP systems would require more complex algorithms and techniques to achieve accurate results.
