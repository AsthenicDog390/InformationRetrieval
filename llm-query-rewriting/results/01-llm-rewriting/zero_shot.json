This is done to make the query more suitable for research and analysis.\n\nHere is an example of how the rewritten query could be answered with a short paragraph:\n\n\"The use of binary choices in referendums has been a contentious issue in UK democracy over the last decade, with both the Leave and Remain campaigns in the 2016 EU referendum highlighting the limitations of this format. On one hand, binary choices can simplify complex issues and increase voter turnout, as seen in the 2011 Scottish independence referendum. On the other hand, the lack of nuance and the potential for misinformation can lead to poor decision-making, as observed in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Furthermore, binary choices can also limit the ability of citizens to engage with complex policy issues, as seen in the 2016 EU referendum. However, proponents of binary choices argue that they can also increase voter engagement and participation, particularly among younger voters, as seen in the 2019 Scottish independence referendum.\" \n\nNote: This is just an example answer, and the actual answer may vary depending on the specific requirements and context of the query. \n\nAlso, the rewritten query can be further refined to make it more",
